### Web Server Setup

Define a host name `local.yiiframework.com` that points to `localhost`.

Define a virtual host of the Web server for `local.yiiframework.com` which uses `yiiframework.com/web`
as the document root.

If you are using Apache, add the following configuration for the `yiiframework.com/web` folder to hide the
entry script:

```
RewriteEngine on

# if a directory or a file exists, use it directly
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# otherwise forward it to index.php
RewriteRule . index.php
```

## DEVELOPMENT

### Build

We use grunt to manage the build tasks, such as compiling LESS into CSS, concatenating and compressing JS files.
You may run `grunt` to watch file changes and automatically trigger the related build tasks. Alternatively you may
manually run `grunt build` to rebuild all tasks.


### CSS Files

* Use LESS files to define CSS styles. 
* All LESS files should be put under `/less` and listed in `/less/all.less`.
* Usually each controller corresponds to a single LESS file whose name is the same as the controller ID.
  For example, the `GuideController` has a LESS file named `guide.less`.
  

### JS Files

* All JS files should be put under `/js` and listed in `/js/all.json`.
* Usually each controller corresponds to a single JS file whose name is the same as the controller ID.
  For example, the `GuideController` has a LESS file named `guide.js`.
