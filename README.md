### Web Server Setup

Define a host name `local.yiiframework.com` that points to `localhost`.

Define a virtual host `local.yiiframework.com` which uses `yiiframework.com/web` as its document root.

If you are using Apache, add the following configuration for the `yiiframework.com/web` folder to hide the
entry script:

```
RewriteEngine on

# if a directory or a file exists, use it directly
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# otherwise forward it to index.php
RewriteRule . index.php
```

## DEVELOPMENT

### Build

* During development, run `grunt` to watch LESS/JS file changes and automatically build target CSS/JS files.
* At any time, run `grunt build` to manually rebuild target CSS/JS files from source LESS/JS files. 


### CSS Files

* Use LESS files to define CSS styles. 
* All LESS files should be put under `/less` and listed in `/less/all.less`.
* Usually each controller corresponds to a single LESS file whose name is the same as the controller ID.
  For example, the `GuideController` has a LESS file named `guide.less`.
  

### JS Files

* All JS files should be put under `/js` and listed in `/js/all.json`.
* Usually each controller corresponds to a single JS file whose name is the same as the controller ID.
  For example, the `GuideController` has a LESS file named `guide.js`.
