yiiframework.com Website
========================

This project contains the source code for the [yiiframework.com](http://yiiframework.com/) Website.

If you want to contribute please get in touch with us using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/yiisoft-contrib/yiiframework.com/issues). We will set up some contributions guidelines soon.


## INSTALLATION

Before you start, make sure you have installed [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
If you are on Debian or Ubuntu you might also want to install the [libnotify-bin](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/libnotify-bin) package, which is used by Gulp to inform you about its status.

If you intend to use the Pageres client to generate screen shots for testing purposes, you need to install the `pageres.cli` tool globally:
~~~
npm install --global pageres-cli
~~~
And then you can use the script `run_pageres.sh` at the root of the source directory to generate screen shots.


### Installation instructions

```
# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/yiisoft-contrib/yiiframework.com.git

cd yiiframework.com

# install the composer asset plugin globally, if you haven't done so before
composer global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:~1.1.1"

# install the dependent composer packages
composer install

# install gulp globally if you haven't done so before
npm install -g gulp

# install browsersync globally if you haven't done so before
npm install -g browser-sync

# At this stage if you're on Windows and having trouble
npm install -g npm
npm -v
# should output 3.x.x
# Also make sure you have MS C++ build tools: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48159

# install dependent NPM modules
npm install

# initialize the application, choose "development"
./init

# build js/css files
gulp build

# If you're on Windows you have to manually symlink or copy
# %appdata%/npm/node_modules/browser-sync to your app's node_modules

# The next step is for building the API documentation and the Guide files.
# It is optional for the site to be working but you will have no API docs and Guide.
# This step includes cloning the Yii 1 and Yii 2 repositories and a lot of computation,
# so you might want to skip it on the first install.
#
# This also requires an instance of elasticsearch to be configured and running
# (if you do not have it, it will still run, but the site search will not work).
# It also assumes you have pdflatex installed for building PDF guide docs.
#
# You may also build only parts of the docs, run  make help  for the available commands.
make docs


```


### Web Server Setup

Define a host name `local.yiiframework.com` that points to `localhost`.

Define a virtual host `local.yiiframework.com` which uses `yiiframework.com/web` as its document root.

If you are using Apache, add the following configuration for the `yiiframework.com/web` folder to hide the
entry script:

```
RewriteEngine on

# if a directory or a file exists, use it directly
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# otherwise forward it to index.php
RewriteRule . index.php
```

### DEPLOYMENT

This section covers notes for deployment on a server, you may not need this for your dev env. OS is assumed to be debian Jessie.

```
apt-get install texlive-full git nodejs npm make
```

## DEVELOPMENT

### Build

* During development, run `gulp` to watch view, Sass and JS file changes and automatically build target CSS/JS files. This command will also launch a browser window which is connected to browsersync.
* At any time, run `gulp build` to manually rebuild target CSS/JS files from source Sass/JS files.
* If you only want to watch for changes, you can issue the command `gulp watch`

### CSS Files

* Use Sass files to define CSS styles.
* All Sass files should be put under `/scss` and listed in `/scss/all.scss`.
* Usually each controller corresponds to a single Sass file whose name is the same as the controller ID.
  For example, the `GuideController` has a Sass file named `_guide.scss`.
* All Sass source files, except `all.scss` should have a leading underscore in the name. Sass will ignore files starting with an underscore so that only one CSS file will be produced (all.css).
* For information about where each file should be put, please consult the master include file `all.scss`.


### JS Files

* All JS files should be put under `/js` and listed in `/js/all.json`.
* Usually each controller corresponds to a single JS file whose name is the same as the controller ID.
  For example, the `GuideController` has a JS file named `guide.js`.
